To start the program, download the JAR file, which is situated in out/artifacts/Morphims_jar

After doing this, execute the following command in terminal: java -jar "%Directory to jar%", where
%Directory to jar% is the path to downloaded jar file.

Running the program DOESN'T need JavaFX to be downloaded in your device, as it is packed inside the JAR.
